### Problem statement 
***
Placements this year have been a strenuous task. Kashyap, Chitranshu and Anshul took
the responsibility of getting the entire batch placed. The work in TPO and a broken
music system has made their life too stressful. Now it's your responsibility to keep
them entertained with a music player while they keep doing their work.
